unimplemented	semantic	You didn't implement this function. Try it next time, it doesn't matter if you get it wrong!

minustenk	semantic	-10000 marks! Don't check if a boolean is true or false, and then return true or false. Return the check directly.

verbose	style	You named variables that are not used and could be underscores.
